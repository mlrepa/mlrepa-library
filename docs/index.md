## REPA principles 

As an ML/MLOps engineer, it is crucial to embrace the REPA principles, which are fundamental to ML engineering and MLOps design. Let's explore each of these principles:

| Principle | Description | Topics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⚛️ **Reliable ML** | **R**:  Ensuring reliability and reproducibility of ML workflows and experiments | Reproducibility, ML System Design, ML Interpretability, A/B testing, etc. |
| 🧪 **Experiments Management** | **E**: Tracking and managing experiments, including data, hyperparameters, and metrics | Metrics Tracking, Experiment Versioning, Model Lifecycle Management, etc. |
| 🛠️ **Pipelines** | **P**: Designing end-to-end ML pipelines for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment | Production ML, Continuous Training, Data Pipelines, CI/CD pipelines, Monitoring pipelines, etc. |
| 🤖 **Automation** | **A**: Automating repetitive tasks and implementing CI/CD practices | Automate ML and Data pipelines, AutoML, CI/CD, etc. |
