## **‚öíÔ∏è Tutorial: Web Services, Frameworks, APIs** 

### **API**

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods, data formats, and conventions that applications can use to request services from each other. 

APIs can be categorized into different types based on their purpose and implementation. Some common types include:

- Internal APIs (custom libraries) - for communication between microservices within an application/company.
- External APIs (web services) - allow third-party developers to access a service over the internet using HTTP or other protocols.

How to reconcile different APIs? - *REST* and *RPC*

### **What is REST?**

REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style used for designing networked applications, particularly web services. RESTful APIs are based on a set of principles and constraints that enable different systems to exchange data over the internet.

<figure markdown>
  ![Untitled](images/2/mlops-2-rest-api.png){ width="700" height="400" }
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

So, REST is a set of [principles](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html#uniform-interface) that enable different systems to exchange data and scale applications. 

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over the network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server handles data storage and processing.
2. **Statelessness**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests, which allows for scalability and reliability.
3. **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs use a uniform and consistent interface for interacting with resources. This includes using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations on resources and utilizing unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to identify resources.
4. **Cacheability**: Responses from the server can be cached by the client, reducing the need for repeated requests to the server. Caching improves performance and efficiency, especially for resources that don't frequently change.
5. **Layered System**: REST allows for a layered architecture, where multiple layers can exist between the client and server. Each layer adds functionality or performs specific tasks, providing flexibility and separation of concerns.
6. **Code-On-Demand (optional)**: Servers can send executable code to the client on-demand, extending the client's functionality. However, this constraint is optional and not commonly used in most REST APIs.

A RESTful API allows performing [CRUD operations](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud) on all objects represented in the system. CRUD - an abbreviation that describes four basic actions:

- **C - Create**
- **R - Read**
- **U - Update**
- **D - Delete**

<figure markdown>
  ![Untitled](images/2/mlops-2-crud.png){width="500" height="200"}
    <figcaption>
    Source: [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest )
    </figcaption>
</figure>

CRUD corresponds the four HTTP methods:

- **POST ‚Äî C**reate a new resource
- **GET ‚Äî R**etrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources
- **PUT ‚Äî U**pdate a specific resource (by id)
- **DELETE ‚Äî D**elete a specific resource by id

The response is usually returned in JSON or XML format (less common). Here is a general REST API model:

<figure markdown>
  ![Untitled](images/2/mlops-2-rest-api-model.png){ width="700" height="400" }
    <figcaption>
    Source: [REST API model](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_what_is_a_rest_api.html)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

**REST API examples** 

- **GET** - Retrieve a list of objects:

Request:

```html
GET /api/train_samples
```

Response:

```json
[
    {id:0, password: 'qwerty', times: 1601},
    {id:1, password: 'admin', times: 1920}
    ...
]
```

- **POST** - Add an object:

Request:

```
POST /api/train_samples/
```

Request object:

```json
{password: '0000', times: 1000}
```

Response:

```json
{id:9, password: '0000', times: 1000}
```

The `id` will be assigned automatically.

- **PUT** - Update a selected record:

Request:

```
PUT /api/train_samples/1
```

Request object:

```json
{id:1, password: 'admin', times: 2000}
```

Response:

```json
{id:1, password: 'admin', times: 2000}
```

- **DELETE** - Delete a selected object:

Request:

```
DELETE /api/train_samples/1
```

### **Response Codes**

| Code | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | The request was successful. |
| 201 | Created | Returned when a resource is created in a collection. |
| 204 | No Content | There is no content. This is a response to a successful request, such as after a DELETE operation. |
|  |  |  |

| Code | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad Request | Client-side error. For example, incorrect request syntax or invalid request parameters. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | The client is trying to access a restricted resource without providing authorization data. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The server understood the request but refuses to process it. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource does not exist. |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | The client attempted to use a method that is not allowed for the resource. For example, using the DELETE method, but the resource does not support it. |
| 500 | Server Error | General response for a server-side error when no other error code is applicable. |

### **cURL tool**

cURL (pronounced "curl") is a command-line tool and library for making HTTP requests and interacting with web services. 

It allows you to send and receive data over various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and more. 

Installation

- Available in MacOS, Ubuntu - accessible from the command line.
- Requires installation on Windows. [Instructions.](https://curl.se/) Alternatively, you can install Git Bush.

!!! Note
    üí° To check the installation in Windows, open the command prompt *cmd* ‚ûú *curl -V*. If installed, you'll see a message like:

    ```bash
    curl 7.55.1 (Windows) libcurl/7.55.1 WinSSL
    ```

</aside>

**Request Examples**

Let‚Äôs look on a few examples of using **cURL**. You may find more examples and practice **cURL** on the [ReqBin website](https://reqbin.com/curl), or check the [cURL documentation page](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).

- **Curl - GET Request**
    
    ```bash
    curl <https://host.com>
    ```
    
    GET method is the default. The same result can be obtained using:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET <https://host.com>
    ```
    
    To get a response with headers:
    
    ```bash
    curl <https://host.com> -i
    ```
    
    The response will contain the HTTP version, status code, and status message (e.g., HTTP/2 200 OK). Then the response headers, an empty line, and the response body.
    
- **Curl - POST Request**
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST <https://host.com>
    ```
    
    Using data transfer (URL-encoded):
    
    ```
    curl -d "option=value_1&something=value_2"
         -X POST <https://host.com/>
    
    ```
    
    Here, `-d` or `--data` is the flag indicating data transfer.
    
- **POST Request using JSON format**
    
    ```bash
    curl -d '{"option": "val"}' 
       -H "Accept:application/json" 
       -X POST https://host.com/
    ```
    
    Here, `-H` or `--header` is the flag for request header.
    
    Alternatively, you can pass the JSON as a file:
    
    ```bash
    curl -d "@file.json"  
         -X POST https://host.com/
    ```
    

**Additional flags:**

- `u user:pass` - for authentication when the server requires it.
- `curl -verbose` - to display detailed information.
- `L` - for handling redirects (if the resource has moved).
- `O` - to save with the same name, or `o data.json` to specify a new name.

### **Drawbacks/Features of REST API:**

- Need to develop language-specific APIs for each language. (Swagger can be used, which we'll cover later)
- JSON for data transfer is not a binary format. Slower data transfer but easier to view data.
- HTTP 1.1 protocol does not support streaming data transfer.

These drawbacks are addressed by **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**.

### **gRPC**

**gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)** is an open-source high-performance framework developed by Google. It is designed for efficient and reliable communication between distributed systems and allows developers to define services and message types using Protocol Buffers (protobuf), a language-agnostic binary serialization format.

gRPC is based on **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call) - invoking remote code on other machines.

    <figcaption>
    Source: [Remote Procedure Call](https://i.imgur.com/BxyZuSA.png%20=280x)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

**Differences:**

- Code generation using standard tools. It uses the **Protoc** compiler, which generates code for multiple languages, including Python.
- Binary data format **Protobuf**, which uses compression for faster data transfer.
- HTTP/2 protocol (since 2015) for streaming data transfer, binary format, and improved performance.

**Which one to choose?:**

- For speed, choose gRPC.
- For monolithic applications accessible externally or via a browser, choose REST API.
- For distributed systems with microservices, choose gRPC.
- For streaming data (e.g., sensor data), choose gRPC.

- [Quick Start and gRPC Guide for Python](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/)

### **OpenAPI** 

<figure markdown>

    <figcaption>
    Source: [OpenAPI](https://i.imgur.com/BxyZuSA.png%20=280x)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The widely accepted format for describing REST APIs is OpenAPI, also known as Swagger.

The specification is a single file in JSON or YAML format, consisting of three sections:

1. Header, containing the API's name, description, version, and additional information.
2. Description of all resources, including their identifiers, HTTP methods, input parameters, response codes, and response body formats.
3. Definitions of objects using JSON Schema format, which can be used for both input parameters and responses.

## **Web Frameworks**

## **Flask**

<figure markdown>
  ![Untitled](images/2/mlops-2-flask.png){width="100" height="30" }
    <figcaption>
    Source: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/#)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

What is it? - A web framework for Python.

Why choose it by default?

- Minimalistic framework.
- Rapid prototyping.
- Low-level framework, which makes it easier to understand Django after learning Flask.

Additionally, Flask is the best choice if:

- Developing a microservices architecture.
- Implementing a REST API without frontend.
- Needing flexible customization.

### **Minimal Flask App**

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

After running the application, you will see the following message:

```bash
~ python app.py
Running on <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>
```

!!! Note
    üí° Localhost - with IP address 127.0.0.1 ‚ûú the computer's internal network.

### **Parameters for app.run()**

**1. Debug mode**:

```python
app.run(debug=True)
```

!!! Note
    The server restarts automatically when code changes.It allows working with a debugger.Remember to disable it when deploying the service.

**2. Make the server publicly accessible**

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

By default, it is only accessible locally.

### **Templates**

A template is a file containing HTML code and markup elements that allow for displaying dynamic content.

The `render_template()` function invokes the Jinja2 template engine, which comes bundled with Flask.

```python
from flask import render_template
```

Templates are stored in the `/templates` directory.

Example of a template (`/templates/index.html`):

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Prediction: {{ pred }}</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Example code that renders the template into an HTML page:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# some code

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', pred=model.prediction)
```

### **Flask API**

**Flask-RESTX** is an extension for Flask that adds support for rapid development of REST APIs.

[Documentation of Flask-RESTX](https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Alternatives: *flask-restplus*, *flask-restful*

A simple example of an application implementing an API with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_restx import Api, Resource, fields

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

passwords = []
a_password = api.model('Resource', {'password': fields.String})

@api.route('/password')
class Prediction(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return passwords

    @api.expect(a_password)
    def post(self):
        passwords.append(api.payload)
        return {'Result': 'pass added'}, 201
```

Flask-RESTX provides a set of tools for generating documentation using Swagger.

The **Swagger API documentation** is generated automatically and can be accessed via the root URL of the API:

    </figcaption>
</figure>

### **Deployment**

[Step-by-step guide on how to deploy a Flask application on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)

Deployment will be covered in more detail in the 4th lecture. It will also be beneficial to have a basic understanding of Git.

## **Django**

<figure markdown>
  ![Untitled](images/2/mlops-2-django.png){width="200" height="50"}
    <figcaption>
    Source: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Django is another popular Python framework for web application or API development.

Features:

- Built-in Django Admin
- Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities and attacks, such as SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, clickjacking, etc.
- ORM support

Django is a good choice for rapid development of scalable applications. However, it may not be the best choice for microservices, simple frontend-less API applications, or database-less applications.

## **FastAPI**

**Advantages:**

- Built-in API documentation
- Asynchronous support
- Validation (with pydantic)
- High performance

Installation:

```
pip install uvicorn fastapi pydantic
```
